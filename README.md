# BattleBotsGame
My first attempt at a terminal game: Battle Bots!

Step 1: Player 1 picks a name and color for their battle bot
Step 2: Player 2 picks a name and color for their battle bot
Step 3: Both players choose a weapon (ATK: is how much damage will be done if an attack connects, SPD: determines the chance to hit, with 100 being a 100% chance and 50 being a 50% chance)
Step 4: FIGHT!
